# Spinning Cube ASCII Art

Welcome to the Spinning Cube ASCII Art project! This repository contains a code sample that demonstrates how to create a spinning cube using ASCII characters in the terminal.

## Background

As a math student, I've always been fascinated by the beauty and intricacies of geometry and trigonometry. This project is a testament to the application of those mathematical concepts in the realm of programming. By leveraging the power of trigonometric functions and matrix transformations, I've managed to project a 3D cube onto a 2D plane (your terminal) and make it spin!

The challenge of converting mathematical ideas into functional code was not trivial. It required a deep understanding of both the mathematical concepts and the programming constructs. But after numerous iterations, optimizations, and debugging sessions, I'm proud to present this spinning cube.

## Why ASCII Art?

ASCII art has always been a fascinating medium for me. It's incredible how simple characters can come together to form intricate and visually appealing designs. This project is a blend of my love for math, programming, and ASCII art. It's a simple yet powerful demonstration of how boundaries between different disciplines can blur to create something beautiful.

## How to Run

To see the spinning cube in action, simply compile and run the `cube.c` file. Make sure your terminal is large enough to fully appreciate the spinning cube!

```bash
gcc cube.c -o cube -lm
./cube
```

## Conclusion

This project was a delightful challenge, and I hope it serves as an inspiration for others to explore the wonderful world of ASCII art and the application of mathematical concepts in programming. Enjoy the spinning cube!
